# Financial Inclusion Analysis: Key Insights & Limitations

## Key Insights
1. **Doubling Inclusion**: Account ownership grew from 22% (2014) to 46% (2021), a CAGR of ~11.2%, significantly outpacing regional laggards but still trailing early adopters like Kenya.
2. **Telebirr Phenomenon**: Since the May 2021 launch, Telebirr scaled to 54.8M users in just 3 years, effectively digitizing half the adult population's potential access points.
3. **Liberalization Boost**: The shift from a state-bank monopoly (pre-2020) to allowing Telebirr and Safaricom (2021+) converted a linear growth trend into an exponential one for digital payments.
4. **The Active Gap**: While 140M accounts exist, only 15% are active. This suggests 'registration inflation' where users hold multiple SIMs but limited utility keeps usage low.
5. **Post-2021 Acceleration**: Contrary to a general economic slowdown, financial inclusion acceleration happened between 2021-2024 specifically because of the entry of Telebirr and M-Pesa.

## Data Limitations
- **Indicator Coverage**: Historical data for 'Usage' (transaction volume/value) is fragmented compared to 'Access' (user counts).
- **Quality & Overlap**: Registered user counts do not account for individuals with multiple SIMs, likely overstating true per-capita adoption.
- **Timing Gaps**: World Bank Findex data is only updated every 3-4 years, leaving gaps in annual trend analysis for formal banking accounts.
- **Rural Coverage**: Data sets rarely provide a clean urban vs. rural split, which is critical for Ethiopia's specific demographic profile.
